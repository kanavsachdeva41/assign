/*
Problem Statement: Smart Parking Billing System
Scenario: You are working as a junior software developer for a smart city project. The cityâ€™s new automated parking lot requires a basic billing software prototype to calculate parking charges for vehicles. The system must handle input of vehicle entry and exit times and then calculate the total amount to be paid.
